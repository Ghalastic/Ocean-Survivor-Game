# Ocean Survivor Game
## Game Objectives:-
### 
•	Navigation: The main objective of the game is to guide the diver through the underwater environment, avoiding or defeating fish and sharks.
•	Collect Ammo: Before diving into the main game, the player must engage in a card game with a computer to collect ammo. Winning a round results in gaining ammo for the player.
•	Defend with Ammo: Use the collected ammo to defend the diver against underwater threats. Each shot requires ammo, and the player can only shoot (by pressing the space bar) if they have enough ammo.
•	Reach the Submarine: The diver must reach the submarine within one minute while avoiding or defeating the underwater creatures. The player’s score is based on how successfully they navigate obstacles.
•	Score: If the diver runs out of ammo or is unable to avoid the dangers, the game ends, and the final score is displayed.

## Description of the Functionalities of the Classes Used in the Code:-
###
1-	The Firstpage class (main menu class): This class produces an interactive "Ocean Survivor" start page with buttons to access the rules, collect ammo, or start the main game. It updates the player's ammunition as they progress. 
2-	The Rules class: This class produces a Rules Window for the "Ocean Survivor" game: a background image, rules text describing the gameplay stages, and a "Close" button for user navigation.
3-	CollectingAmmo class (card game class): The class produces a card game window where the user plays a 3-round card battle against the computer, selecting one of three cards per round to accumulate ammo based on the game's rules. There is a "Back" button for user navigation.
4-	Game class (main game class): This class creates a game called "Ocean Survivor", where the player navigates a diver, avoids obstacles, and can fire bullets collected in the card game to earn points. The obstacle’s speed increases every 10 seconds. The game ends either with the player reaching the submarine or the game over text shows up on the screen, depending on the player's performance. At the top of the window are the score, total ammo, timer with 60 seconds to reach the submarine, and a "Back" button for user navigation.
